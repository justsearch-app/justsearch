/**
 * messageClasses — tempdoc 613 §5.2/§8: the ONE closed vocabulary of FE-LOCAL message classes.
 *
 * The `emitEphemeralToast` channel (559 Authority III) previously took a free-form `classId`
 * string, so the routing-relevant policy of a local transient (does it supersede? what tone?) was
 * chosen ad hoc per call site and the class set could drift. This module closes that:
 *
 *  - **Collapse** — `EphemeralToastSpec.classId` is typed as {@link LocalMessageClass} (the keys
 *    below), so an undeclared classId fails to typecheck; a free-form local class is unrepresentable.
 *  - **Declared policy** — each class declares its policy once (the load-bearing axes are
 *    `supersede` and `defaultSeverity`; the local toast channel is always `EPHEMERAL`). The emit
 *    helper resolves a call's `supersede`/`severity` from the class, so the class — not the call
 *    site — is the single source for that behavior.
 *  - **Gate** — `scripts/ci/check-message-classes.mjs` (register
 *    `governance/message-classes.v1.json`) enforces forward+backward correspondence between the
 *    classes declared here and the classes actually emitted, the proven 602 §D.0 pattern.
 *
 * NOTE — scope: this is the FE-LOCAL EMIT vocabulary only. The WIRE `AdvisoryEvent.classId` stays a
 * `string` (it also carries backend advisory classes — `operation.completed`, `health.recoverable`,
 * … — whose chrome lives in `AdvisoryClassChrome.ts`). Widening a `LocalMessageClass` into that
 * string field is safe.
