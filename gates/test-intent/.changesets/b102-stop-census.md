# Dev-runner stop and exit census after a long run

All changed checks are script self-tests under `scripts/`, which
`docs/reference/testing/test-intent.md` excludes from the product-test gate, and
`run-evidence.mjs` has runners for Gradle, vitest and cargo only. No Java, frontend-module,
Rust, build-selection or governance-tooling file changes. The empty gate entry list reflects
that scope; the intent and the execution record below still need the orchestrator's
independent verifier. The builder supplies no acceptance record.

Intent source: **delegated-choice**, label **agent choice**. Delegation quote:
"do whatever you think is best. your working autonomously". Delegation location:
task t-20261005-b6d536 user turn 2026-10-11T16:05Z (F:/agent-sandbox/design-b6d536/owner-turns-886833dd.md:94).
Scope: task t-20261005-b6d536, process ownership and exit accounting.

Choices, decided by the orchestrator under that delegation after the quiet-machine measurement of
b599d4d7e (run 8f60c4e7, item 6 defects of the dev-runner stop and census):

- A recorded identity whose exit is in the Engine's exit ledger (same PID and creation time) is
  gone and is not probed again. A live process whose creation time cannot be read never matches a
  recorded identity with a known exit; it still blocks only when nothing proves the recorded
  identity ended. (Run 8f60c4e7: console host 24536 exited at 14:56:55 per the ledger; Windows
  gave the PID to svchost.exe at 15:11:32, whose birth the stop could not read, and the stop
  reported it as a surviving Engine job member.)
- The census reads each ledger file once per stop and indexes it by identity; it does not
  re-parse per pass. (Each pass took about 17.7 s on the 17 MB ledger and ran at least twice, so
  the stop exceeded its 60 s limit.)
- A retried stop never overwrites an earlier census; it keeps it and adds to it. With the Engine
  already gone, the retry still completes the census from the ledger, and reports it complete
  when every recorded identity has an exit.

What changed:

- `scripts/dev/lib/stop-exit-census.cjs`: the stop's census returns `endedIdentities()`, the
  run's Engine incarnations, ledger children and job witnesses with an exit record (a
  reconciliation's IDENTITY_UNKNOWN record proves nothing). One incremental reader serves the
  stop (`exit-ledger.cjs` `createIncrementalReader`: a file, known by its file id and first
  bytes, is parsed once; later reads parse only the complete lines appended since). The ledger
  view reads each helper window's instants once and finds windows, owner records, console
  parents and report rows through PID and image indexes instead of rescanning every record per
  helper; on the run's own 17 MB ledger the view went from 34.9 s to 0.09 s with output identical
  to b599d4d7e apart from `exitAccountingComplete`. A retried stop renames the earlier
  `exit-targets.json` and `process-exits.json` to the next free `.N.json`, merges every kept
  census's OS exits (and the targets it observed them for) into its verdict, and writes the
  merged OS exits back to `process-exits.json`. `exitAccountingComplete` is true with no gap
  when a target was armed or the run's Engine incarnations are in the ledger.
- `scripts/dev/lib/stop-job-run.ps1` and `job-run.cjs` (`stopJobRunSync` option
  `endedIdentities`, passed through a temporary `-EndedPath` file): identities the ledger shows
  ended are skipped by the job stop's probes and reported as `endedPerLedger`.
- `scripts/dev/dev-runner.cjs` `stopRun`: the Engine job stop gets the ledger's ended identities;
  a tracked or recorded identity whose state is unknown is resolved when the ledger records its
  exit, and listed in the stop report as `resolvedByLedger`.

New script check `scripts/dev/test-dev-runner-stop-census.mjs` (6 cases). Each fails by
assertion on b599d4d7e and passes after:

1. Real `stop-job-run.ps1`: a job member whose PID now names a running process whose birth
   cannot be read (found at run time, query rights only) is a survivor without the ledger and is
   gone with its ledger exit.
2. Real `stopRun` with the real census, identity lookup and job stop, the Engine gone: on
   b599d4d7e it reports `STOP_INCOMPLETE` with "Engine job: incomplete (pid N still running)",
   the incident's error; after, `STOPPED`, `endedPerLedger` names the member, census complete.
3. A tracked identity the lookup cannot read is resolved by its ledger exit; one without a ledger
   exit still blocks.
4. A retried census keeps the earlier census verbatim (`process-exits.1.json`,
   `exit-targets.1.json`), accounts the Engine with the earlier OS exit and is complete.
5. A stop that finds the Engine gone is complete from the ledger; an identity without its exit
   record still leaves it incomplete.
6. A stop over a 17 MiB synthetic ledger shaped like run 8f60c4e7's (2229 job processes, helper
   receipts, helper windows, rotated files): b599d4d7e took 167,572 ms and read 71,308,464
   ledger bytes; after, 4,614 ms and 17,832,236 bytes (ledger 17,827,116 bytes). It asserts at
   most 20 s and at most one read of each ledger file.
